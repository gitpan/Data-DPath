NAME
    Data::DPath - Path based data manipulation

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::DPath;

     my $dp = Data::DPath -> new( hash => {
         this => {
             that => {
                 foo => 'bar'
             },
         }
     } );

     my $dataset = $dp -> find('/this/that/foo');

     foreach my $node ($dataset -> get_nodelist) {
         my $stringref = $node -> get_data;
         print "$$stringref should be 'bar'\n";
     }

DESCRIPTION

This is an early alpha release of Data::DPath.  The only axis that 
should currently work is the child:: axis.  See the t/axis_child test 
in the build directory for examples.

New releases will be made in the 0.00_xx versions as new axes and other 
parts of the DPath scheme are added (DPath is based on XPath and does 
for Perl data structures what XPath does for XML).

API
    The API of Data::DPath is very similar to that of XML::XPath.

  new()

  $dataset = find($path, [$context])

  $context = Data::DPath::Context -> new({ this => that });

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Data::DPath package is based on XML::XPath.  I took the XML::XPath 
tarball and changed it into Data::DPath, for the most part.
